### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yue Zhang (ç« å²³). You can call me Yue or Hill (å²³ means hill in Chinese).

- ðŸŒ± I am currently a researcher at ByteDance Seed Team. Before this, I received my Master's degree (advised by [Prof. Zhenghua Li](http://hlt.suda.edu.cn/~zhli/)) and Bachelor's degree (2017-2021, software engineering) from Soochow University.
- ðŸ‘¯ Previously, I interned at Alibaba DAMO Academy (from 2021.07 to 2023) and Tencent AI Lab (from 2023.02 to 2024).
- ðŸ¤” Previously, my main research interests focused on deep learning for natural language generation (NLG), e.g., grammatical error correction. Now, I am trying to adjust my research direction to Large Language Models (LLM) and their applications.
